--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::DNS is an asynchronous POE wrapper for
Net::DNS::Resolver.  It accepts events containing Resolver questions,
and it emits events carrying Net::DNS::Packet responses.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE and Net::DNS.  The requirements are encoded
in Makefile.PL, so the CPAN shell should do the right thing.  If this
is installed without the CPAN shell, the person installing it will
have to do the right thing manually.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Client::DNS may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Client::DNS'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Client::DNS

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Client::DNS

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Client::DNS can also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should hold the latest
version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test program, t/01_resolve.t, makes an excellent sample program.
In fact, it was adapted from the sample program used to debug this
component.  If you would like to see more details about the test's
operation, edit t/01_resolve.t and set the DEBUG constant to any value
Perl considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
