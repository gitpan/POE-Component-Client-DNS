    Shevek reported a problem with getpeername() failing. I added code to
    test the intermediate results from getpeername() so that internal
    errors would be avoided if it fails.

    Add a note to the requirements. This module must be tested with a
    valid name server available.

    Eric Cholet discovered that _default was returning 1. That causes bad
    things in POE's new "three-phase" signal dispatch. Namely, it means
    the entire program would never exit on a signal. Gah! Changed it to
    return 0 instead, which lets some other part of the program decide if
    things should die.

    Fix my e-mail address. :)

    Add cvs2cl to the makefile builder so we don't need to manage CHANGES
    ourselves anymore. Yay!
