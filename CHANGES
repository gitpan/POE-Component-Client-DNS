  2006-05-21 20:45:11 (r58) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Bump up the version. 

  2006-05-21 20:44:39 (r57) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Fix shutdown(). It was not performing nearly enough cleanup.
    
    Replace some post() calls with call() to avoid race conditions. In
    general, method interfaces should use call() rather than post() so
    that they affect internal structures synchronously.

    Turn on ASSERT_DEFAULT for some of the tests. Add _stop handlers so
    they don't fail with all POE asserts on. 

  2006-03-24 03:58:51 (r55) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Belatedly bump up the version.

  2005-12-05 18:34:05 (r53) by rcaputo; t/04_errors.t M

    Add the CATCH_EXCEPTIONS toggle that lets me catch my own damn
    errors. Sweet! Also expanded the common test code so that line
    numbers would be properly reported.

  2005-08-01 17:07:05 (r51) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Make the hosts file size significant when checking for changes. 

  2005-08-01 17:06:41 (r50) by rcaputo; t/06_hosts.t M

    Force an inode change in the tests, although this doesn't really have
    an effect. 

  2005-08-01 17:02:16 (r49) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Update dependencies to match newest modules.

  2005-07-29 15:41:12 (r47) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Bump version for release. 

  2005-07-28 05:59:31 (r46) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Some systems include IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for "localhost". OS X is
    one of them. This commit causes the component to prefer IPv4
    addresses when there's a choice. It's a bad fix, but it'll have to do
    for now. We really should check whether the request is for an A or
    AAAA record and use the appropriate address.

  DNS.pm M; MANIFEST M; t/06_hosts.t A

    Cache /etc/hosts (or its equivalent) in memory. This should save some
    CPU and disk access, even though the module must stat() /etc/hosts
    for each request. This closes rt.cpan.org ticket 7916.
    
    Let the user supply an /etc/hosts (or equivalent) file at component
    creation time. This lets them find hosts files in obscure locations,
    plus it lets us write a test that verifies the caching logic by using
    specific hosts files. This closes rt.cpan.org ticket 13581. 

  2005-06-21 13:38:43 (r44) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M; Makefile.PL M

    Remove META.yml from MANIFEST. It seems that "make dist" inserts it
    and creates a META.yml file in the distribution but not in the
    working copy.
    
    Change cvs-log.perl to svn-log.perl in Makefile.PL.
