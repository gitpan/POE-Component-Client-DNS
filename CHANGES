    Bump version for release. 

  2005-07-28 05:59:31 (r46) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Some systems include IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for "localhost". OS X is
    one of them. This commit causes the component to prefer IPv4
    addresses when there's a choice. It's a bad fix, but it'll have to do
    for now. We really should check whether the request is for an A or
    AAAA record and use the appropriate address.

  DNS.pm M; MANIFEST M; t/06_hosts.t A

    Cache /etc/hosts (or its equivalent) in memory. This should save some
    CPU and disk access, even though the module must stat() /etc/hosts
    for each request. This closes rt.cpan.org ticket 7916.
    
    Let the user supply an /etc/hosts (or equivalent) file at component
    creation time. This lets them find hosts files in obscure locations,
    plus it lets us write a test that verifies the caching logic by using
    specific hosts files. This closes rt.cpan.org ticket 13581. 

  2005-06-21 13:38:43 (r44) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M; Makefile.PL M

    Remove META.yml from MANIFEST. It seems that "make dist" inserts it
    and creates a META.yml file in the distribution but not in the
    working copy.
    
    Change cvs-log.perl to svn-log.perl in Makefile.PL.

=========================

  2004-10-07 03:34:35 (r42) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Bump the version to 0.98 for release, and document the deprecations
    more carefully. 

  2004-10-07 03:16:45 (r41) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Add code to look for /etc/hosts in various other places on Windows
    systems. Oh, the horrors!

  t/04_errors.t M; t/05_api_4.t A; MANIFEST M

    Added new tests to cover the additional public interface. 

  2004-10-07 03:03:42 (r39) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Added the "version 4" interface, which is just a method in front of
    the "version 3" interface. The method-based interface lets us build a
    resolver cache later. The component will be able to return resolver
    answers from the cache without incurring any POE event loop overhead.
    
    Documented the new interface. Updated the SYNOPSIS to show it. Tested
    the SYNOPSIS code.
    
    Changed the private event handler names to include a leading
    underscore, so that Pod::Coverage will automatically discount them in
    its reports.
    
    Switched to object methods as event handlers. Moved the HEAP data
    into $self. This lets us get at the data members from the public
    object methods and the public/private event handlers. 

  2004-10-07 01:23:43 (r38) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Rewrite the documentation to explain the new interface. 

  2004-10-07 01:23:08 (r37) by rcaputo; t/03_api_3.t M

    Remove some unnecessary code from this test. A previous test was
    copied as the basis for this one, and some useless code came along.

  DNS.pm M; t/03_api_3.t A; t/04_errors.t A; MANIFEST M; Makefile.PL M

    Add a saner (currently undocumented) API, and maintain backward
    compatibility. Increase test coverage to >80%. 

  2004-06-12 16:51:31 (r35) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    "Overlord Q" reported a syntax error in the SYNOPSIS. This change
    corrects the mistake and improves the code's readability. 

  2004-02-13 02:21:12 (r34) by rcaputo; MANIFEST M

    Add META.yml to the MANIFEST.
