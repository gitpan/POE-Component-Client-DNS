    Jonathan Yu found a warning while packaging this distro for Debian.
    I've applied his patch from rt.cpan.org 48335, and I took his
    suggestion to start using Test::NoWarnings.
    
    Philip Gwyn found a strange case where IPv6 localhost was returned as
    ::1 rather than the long form. Added a check for both forms.
    
    Bumped the version to 1.050 for release. 

  2009-08-28 06:03:27 (r82) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Fix a POD error (line too long, broken link to RT) reported by
    Jonathan Yu, ironically in rt.cpan.org ticket 48336. :) 

  2009-08-17 04:36:45 (r81) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Fix a warning for /etc/hosts files that contain blank lines or
    comments. Suggested by Leonid Rashkovsky in e-mail.

  2009-07-28 06:01:07 (r79) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M; Makefile.PL M

    Use latest POE, and prepare for a new release.

  2009-07-27 04:51:28 (r78) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M; Makefile.PL M

    Added a machine-readable repository directory to the distribution.
    Documented the bug tracker, repository, and other resource URLs.

    Resolve (heh) rt.cpan.org ticket #13899. AAAA requests will check for
    IPv6 addresses in /etc/hosts or your favorite operating system's
    equivalent.

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket #13492 by Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni,
    #14723 by Branislav Gerzo, and umbrella ticket #15009 by cycling
    through the list of resolvers known to Net::DNS if the top one times
    out.

    Applied a patch by René Mayorga, resolving rt.cpan.org ticket 41313.
    René's patch uses Net::DNS to find poe.perl.org's address and use
    that instead of hardcoded values. Thanks also go to René for
    submitting the patch through rt.cpan.org. I may never have discovered
    ticket 506915 on bugs.debian.org.

    Fix warnings uncovered by POE's recent global-warning issue. 

  2009-02-02 07:50:33 (r72) by hachi; DNS.pm M

    Make it safe to have more than one PoCoDNS object.
    
    Somehow this bug has been no problem for people this entire time. An
    amazing trick really :D

    A host-file test was failing because its address segments were wider
    than single octets.
