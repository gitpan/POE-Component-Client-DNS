	* DNS.pm: Shevek reported a problem with getpeername() failing.  I
	added code to test the intermediate results from getpeername() so
	that internal errors would be avoided if it fails.

	* README: Add a note to the requirements.  This module must be
	tested with a valid name server available.

	* CHANGES: Removed CHANGES.  Now we use cvs2cl to generate it at
	distribution time.  Thanks again to Matt Cashner (sungo) for this
	advice.

	* DNS.pm: Eric Cholet discovered that _default was returning 1. 
	That causes bad things in POE's new "three-phase" signal dispatch. 
	Namely, it means the entire program would never exit on a signal. 
	Gah!  Changed it to return 0 instead, which lets some other part of
	the program decide if things should die.

	* Makefile.PL: Fix my e-mail address. :)

	* Makefile.PL: Add cvs2cl to the makefile builder so we don't need
	to manage CHANGES ourselves anymore.  Yay!
