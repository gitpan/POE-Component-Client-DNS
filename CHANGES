    Retry from the "nameservers" parameter, if supplied.

    If a resolver times out, rotate through the nameservers provided by
    the "nameservers" parameter, not the default ones or whatever was
    last sent to Net::DNS' resolver.

    Jonathan Yu found a warning while packaging this distro for Debian.
    I've applied his patch from rt.cpan.org 48335, and I took his
    suggestion to start using Test::NoWarnings.

    Philip Gwyn found a strange case where IPv6 localhost was returned as
    ::1 rather than the long form. Added a check for both forms.

    Bumped the version to 1.050 for release.

    Applied a patch by René Mayorga, resolving rt.cpan.org ticket 41313.
    René's patch uses Net::DNS to find poe.perl.org's address and use
    that instead of hardcoded values. Thanks also go to René for
    submitting the patch through rt.cpan.org. I may never have discovered
    ticket 506915 on bugs.debian.org.

    Some rt.cpan.org tickets refer to issues in Net::DNS. Require the
    latest version of that dependency in the hopes that some things are
    fixed. Too bad I don't have test cases for those issues... there's no
    way for me to tell if anything's fixed by this simple change.

    Fix shutdown(). It was not performing nearly enough cleanup.

    Replace some post() calls with call() to avoid race conditions. In
    general, method interfaces should use call() rather than post() so
    that they affect internal structures synchronously.

    Some systems include IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for "localhost". OS X is
    one of them. This commit causes the component to prefer IPv4
    addresses when there's a choice. It's a bad fix, but it'll have to do
    for now. We really should check whether the request is for an A or
    AAAA record and use the appropriate address.

    Cache /etc/hosts (or its equivalent) in memory. This should save some
    CPU and disk access, even though the module must stat() /etc/hosts
    for each request. This closes rt.cpan.org ticket 7916.

    Let the user supply an /etc/hosts (or equivalent) file at component
    creation time. This lets them find hosts files in obscure locations,
    plus it lets us write a test that verifies the caching logic by using
    specific hosts files. This closes rt.cpan.org ticket 13581.

    Remove META.yml from MANIFEST. It seems that "make dist" inserts it

  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date : 2004-10-07 03:03:42 +0000

    Added the "version 4" interface, which is just a method in front of
    the "version 3" interface. The method-based interface lets us build a
    resolver cache later. The component will be able to return resolver
    answers from the cache without incurring any POE event loop overhead.

    Documented the new interface. Updated the SYNOPSIS to show it. Tested
    the SYNOPSIS code.

    Changed the private event handler names to include a leading
    underscore, so that Pod::Coverage will automatically discount them in
    its reports.

    Switched to object methods as event handlers. Moved the HEAP data
    into $self. This lets us get at the data members from the public
    object methods and the public/private event handlers.

    Eric Cholet discovered that _default was returning 1. That causes bad
    things in POE's new "three-phase" signal dispatch. Namely, it means
    the entire program would never exit on a signal. Gah! Changed it to
    return 0 instead, which lets some other part of the program decide if
