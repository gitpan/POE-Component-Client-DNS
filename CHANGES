    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket #13492 by Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni,
    #14723 by Branislav Gerzo, and umbrella ticket #15009 by cycling

    Applied a patch by René Mayorga, resolving rt.cpan.org ticket 41313.
    René's patch uses Net::DNS to find poe.perl.org's address and use
    that instead of hardcoded values. Thanks also go to René for
    submitting the patch through rt.cpan.org. I may never have discovered
    ticket 506915 on bugs.debian.org.
