  commit e88dccf85d700690d4dfa2a4b96a2503436a9bf3
  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>

    Jonathan Yu found a warning while packaging this distro for Debian.
    I've applied his patch from rt.cpan.org 48335, and I took his
    suggestion to start using Test::NoWarnings.

    Philip Gwyn found a strange case where IPv6 localhost was returned as
    ::1 rather than the long form. Added a check for both forms.

    Bumped the version to 1.050 for release.

    Fix a POD error (line too long, broken link to RT) reported by
    Jonathan Yu, ironically in rt.cpan.org ticket 48336. :)

    Applied a patch by René Mayorga, resolving rt.cpan.org ticket 41313.
    René's patch uses Net::DNS to find poe.perl.org's address and use
    that instead of hardcoded values. Thanks also go to René for
    submitting the patch through rt.cpan.org. I may never have discovered
    ticket 506915 on bugs.debian.org.
