=========================

  2004-10-07 03:34:35 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.20

    Bump the version to 0.98 for release, and document the deprecations
    more carefully. 

  2004-10-07 03:16:45 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.19

    Add code to look for /etc/hosts in various other places on Windows
    systems. Oh, the horrors! 

  2004-10-07 03:04:31 by rcaputo
  MANIFEST 1.6; t/04_errors.t 1.2; t/05_api_4.t 1.1

    Added new tests to cover the additional public interface. 

  2004-10-07 03:03:42 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.18

    Added the "version 4" interface, which is just a method in front of
    the "version 3" interface. The method-based interface lets us build a
    resolver cache later. The component will be able to return resolver
    answers from the cache without incurring any POE event loop overhead.
    
    Documented the new interface. Updated the SYNOPSIS to show it. Tested
    the SYNOPSIS code.
    
    Changed the private event handler names to include a leading
    underscore, so that Pod::Coverage will automatically discount them in
    its reports.
    
    Switched to object methods as event handlers. Moved the HEAP data
    into $self. This lets us get at the data members from the public
    object methods and the public/private event handlers. 

  2004-10-07 01:23:43 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.17

    Rewrite the documentation to explain the new interface. 

  2004-10-07 01:23:08 by rcaputo; t/03_api_3.t 1.2

    Remove some unnecessary code from this test. A previous test was
    copied as the basis for this one, and some useless code came along. 

  2004-10-06 18:06:11 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.16; MANIFEST 1.5;
  Makefile.PL 1.7; t/03_api_3.t 1.1; t/04_errors.t 1.1

    Add a saner (currently undocumented) API, and maintain backward
    compatibility. Increase test coverage to >80%. 

  2004-06-12 16:51:31 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.15

    "Overlord Q" reported a syntax error in the SYNOPSIS. This change
    corrects the mistake and improves the code's readability. 

  2004-02-13 02:21:12 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.4

    Add META.yml to the MANIFEST.

=========================

  2004-02-02 21:29:34 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.14

    Bump release to 0.97. 

  2003-11-26 20:49:39 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.13; t/02_tag_args.t 1.2

    Net::DNS::Resolver's bgsend() sometimes fails and returns undef
    instead of a socket handle. This commit adds automatic retrying when
    bgsend() fails, up to the timeout period.

2003-11-22 06:34:07 v0_96

  2003-11-22 06:34:07 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.12

    Bump up the version for release. 

  2003-11-22 05:33:01 by rcaputo; DNS.pm 1.11; t/01_resolve.t 1.3

    Minor style changes. Nothing important.
