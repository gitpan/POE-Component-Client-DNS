    By the power of PAUSEskull, this is a fine morning! Release 1.00! 

  2007-01-06 18:11:52 (r63) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Expose the underlying Net::DNS::Resolver with a get_resolver()
    accessor. Thanks to Chris Williams for kinda suggesting it. :)

    Set a LICENSE. Cheap kwalitee points!

    Don't try to call a method on a failed request. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    21190 by Alexandr Ciornii.

    Some rt.cpan.org tickets refer to issues in Net::DNS. Require the
    latest version of that dependency in the hopes that some things are
    fixed. Too bad I don't have test cases for those issues... there's no
    way for me to tell if anything's fixed by this simple change.

    Bump up the version. 

  2006-05-21 20:44:39 (r57) by rcaputo; DNS.pm M

    Fix shutdown(). It was not performing nearly enough cleanup.
    
    Replace some post() calls with call() to avoid race conditions. In
    general, method interfaces should use call() rather than post() so
    that they affect internal structures synchronously.

    Turn on ASSERT_DEFAULT for some of the tests. Add _stop handlers so
    they don't fail with all POE asserts on.

    Belatedly bump up the version.
